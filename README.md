Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for building robust APIs and handling backend logic efficiently.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for executing server-side code and handling HTTP requests/responses.

Angular: A powerful client-side framework for building single-page applications (SPAs) with reactive UI and dynamic data binding.

TypeScript: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and scalability.
