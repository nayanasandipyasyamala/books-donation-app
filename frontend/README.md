Books donation website created using HTML 5, CSS3, MongoDB, Node.js, Express, Typescript and Angular.

✏️ MONGODB is a no SQL database which stores "Documents" in "collections". It is a powerful database which can easily be integrated into a Node or Express environment.

✏️ EXPRESS is a Node framework which simplifies writing server-side code and logic.

✏️ ANGULAR is a client-side (browser) framework which allows us to build single-page application (SPA). It handles the user input and communicate with backend services.

✏️ NODEJS is a server-side library that listens to requests and sends responses. It interacts with databases and files.
